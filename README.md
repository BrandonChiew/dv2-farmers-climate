## Run it locally
The charts fetch their JSON and CSV files, so open the page through a web server, not `file://`:

```
python3 -m http.server
```
then visit http://localhost:8000.

## What is where
| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | the page: hero, nine story sections, footer |
| `assets/hero.svg`, `assets/hero-front.svg` | hero drawing (back layer, and the wheat stalks in front of the title); swap in your own drawing here |
| `css/style.css` | design tokens, layout, layered SVG scenes, phone layout |
| `js/main.js` | embeds every chart, the guess game, the rain slider, the page-wide year link, text readouts computed from the CSVs |
| `js/*.vl.json` | one Vega-Lite spec per chart (list below) |
| `data/processed/` | cleaned files the page loads |
| `data/raw/` | original downloads (large zips are not committed) |
| `data/scripts/clip_isohyets.py` | builds the wheat-belt outline and the south-west WA rain bands from the isohyet TopoJSON |
| `data/SOURCES.md` | where every file came from |

## Charts
| Spec | Idiom | Interaction |
|---|---|---|
| `guess.vl.json` | bar chart, guess-first | drag the 2019 bar (or slider), reveal button; guess is kept for the last section |
| `map_isohyets.vl.json` | isohyet bands (scalar field map) + proportional circles | tooltips |
| `panorama.vl.json` | four linked rows on one year axis: ENSO strip, rain capsule heatmap, wheat area, income "roots" | click a year (or use the slider): the light column moves and later charts follow |
| `nsw_scatter.vl.json` | connected scatterplot | "be the farmer" rain slider; follows the selected year |
| `choropleths.vl.json` | choropleth small multiples (2 × 2) | tooltips |
| `wa_map.vl.json` | WA map with rain-band overlay + locator | tooltips |
| `wa_scatter.vl.json` | scatterplot | follows the selected year |
| `swing.vl.json` | dumbbell + slopegraph | hover a state to highlight it in both |
| `streamgraph.vl.json` | streamgraph | tooltips; follows the selected year |
| `diverging.vl.json` | diverging bars | tooltips |

## Data
Bureau of Meteorology (rainfall series and grid, ENSO history, Annual Climate Statements), ABARES (Australian Crop Report and Agricultural commodities, September 2026) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (state boundaries). Details in `data/SOURCES.md`.

## AI use
Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant, used through Claude Code) did this:
- wrote the HTML, CSS and JavaScript (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`) and every Vega-Lite spec in `js/*.vl.json`
- drew the SVG illustrations (hero, night scene, farm strip, icons) from my description of the scenes
- processed the raw downloads in `data/raw/` into `data/processed/` with scripts (`data/scripts/`)
- helped plan the page structure
- made wording edits to the text when I asked

I did this:
- chose the topic and the story
- picked the data sources
- wrote the text
- designed the hero scene
- chose the fonts and colours
- tested the page and checked the numbers
